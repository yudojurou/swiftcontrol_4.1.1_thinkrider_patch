# Patch to bikecontrol 4.1.1 (backport that enables Thinkrider VS200 support)
<img src="bikecontrol_vs200.png" alt="bikecontrol"/>
This is a backport patch to jonasbark/swiftcontrol version 4.1.1 to support Thinkrider vs200 shifter.
I am not the author of this code. It's been 100% written by jonasbark.
The newer versions support the controller out of the box but are tightly integrated with Windows store.
The main reason for this patch is to avoid non-anonymous contact with the Windows Store.

I am not providing binaries. You have to put your own work and effort. I strongly encourage you to use the official build and support the author.
If you find this patch useful please consider donating jonasbark.
